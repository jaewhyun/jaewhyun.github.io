I'm a Software Engineer at Pinterest 👩🏻‍💻 working on the internal tools team.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projectsandblogs">**Check out my projects and blog posts!**</a>

I grew up in 🇰🇷 and 🇨🇦. I went to college in Atlanta, worked in Boston, went to grad school in 🗽, and currently live in Seattle, WA📍.

I love to sleep 💤 (who doesn't though) but caffeine is also my best friend. Usually, in my free time, you can find me catching up on my favourite tv-shows, doing a 1000 piece puzzle, or attempting to read a book. I also enjoy lifting 🏋🏻‍, cooking & baking 👩🏻‍🍳, eating my way through the city, and hiking ⛰️ when there are no bugs.
And probably just like everyone else, I would like to travel the 🌏 one day.
