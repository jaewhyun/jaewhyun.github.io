  Hi, I'm Jae.
</p>

I'm a second year graduate student in the NYU Courant Institute MSCS program, interested in software development and data analytics.

I grew up in South Korea and Canada. I went to college in Atlanta, worked in Boston, and currently live in NYC!
I love to sleep (who doesn't though) but caffeine is also my best friend! I like to lift, play soccer and rugby, and eat my way through the city!
More often than not, I cook and bake in my tiny, non-ventilated NYC apartment (apologies to my roommate) and catch up on tv-shows/newest movies.
I'm terrified of bugs but I like to pretend that I'm a fun, outdoor-loving person to go hiking and camping.
And probably just like everyone else, I would like to travel the world one day.

If you would like to connect with me, please feel free to reach me at:
