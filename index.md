I'm a second year graduate student in the NYU Courant Institute MSCS program, interested in software development and data analytics 👩🏻‍💻.

I grew up in 🇰🇷 and 🇨🇦. I went to college in Atlanta, worked in Boston, and currently live in NYC📍.

I love to sleep (who doesn't though) but caffeine is also my best friend. <br>I enjoy lifting, playing ⚽ and rugby, and eating my way through the city!
More often than not, I cook and bake in my tiny, non-ventilated NYC apartment 👩🏻‍🍳 (apologies to my roommate) and catch up on tv-shows/newest movies.
I'm terrified of bugs but I like to pretend that I'm a fun, outdoor-loving person to go hiking ⛰️ and camping 🏕️.
And probably just like everyone else, I would like to travel the 🌏 one day.
